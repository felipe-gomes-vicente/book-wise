### üíª Book Wise
Book Wise is an application for the user to evaluate books. There, the user can create their evaluation for the available books.
The application has its own database, with a pre-registered list of books. To create reviews, the user must log in, which can be done using Google or GitHub. On the first Login, the user will be automatically registered with the Bank. For other logins, the user's information will already be loaded directly from this Bank.
